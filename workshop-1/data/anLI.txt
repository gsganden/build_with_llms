    Despite having worked on AI since I was a teenager, I’m now more excited than ever about what we can do with it, especially in building AI applications. Sparks are flying in our field, and 2025 will be a great year for building! One aspect of AI that I’m particularly excited about is how easy it is to build software prototypes. AI is lowering the cost of software development and expanding the set of possible applications. While it can help extend or maintain large software systems, it shines particularly in building prototypes and other simple applications quickly. If you want to build an app to print out flash cards for your kids (I just did this in a couple of hours with o1’s help), or write an application that monitors foreign exchange rates to manage international bank accounts (a real example from DeepLearning.AI’s finance team), or analyzes user reviews automatically to quickly flag problems with your products (DeepLearning.AI's content team does this), it is now possible to build these applications quickly through AI-assisted coding. I find AI-assisted coding especially effective for prototyping because (i) stand-alone prototypes require relatively little context and software integration and (ii) prototypes in alpha testing usually don’t have to be reliable. While generative AI also helps with engineering large, mission-critical software systems, the improvements in productivity there aren't as dramatic, because it’s challenging to give the AI system all the context it needs to navigate a large codebase and also to make sure the generated code is reliable (for example, covering all important corner cases). Until now, a huge friction point for getting a prototype into users’ hands has been deployment. Platforms like Bolt, Replit Agent, Vercel V0 use generative AI with agentic workflows to improve code quality, but more importantly, they also help deploy generated applications directly. (While I find these systems useful, my own workflow typically uses an LLM to design the system architecture and then generate code, one module at a time if there are multiple large modules. Then I test each module, edit the code further if needed — sometimes using an AI-enabled IDE like Cursor — and finally assemble the modules.) Building prototypes quickly is an efficient way to test ideas and get tasks done. It’s also a great way to learn. Perhaps most importantly, it’s really fun! (At least I think it is. 😄) [Reached length limit; full text: https://lnkd.in/gki7_qGv ], Happy New Year!

            AI Fund is a venture studio that partners with entrepreneurs to build AI companies that move humanity forward. We don't just provide capital, we actively help build the company: we seek to play at least a minor co-founder role in the companies we engage in. 

            After identifying a concrete startup idea, we actively help the founder validate both customer need and technical feasibility (often collaborating to build a technical prototype), help shape the AI technology roadmap, the go-to-market, and help recruit the key leaders, including the AI engineering team. 

            Because AI is a general purpose technology that can be applied to numerous sectors -- including ones that we at AI Fund don't have expertise in -- we partner with subject matter experts (SMEs) in logistics, healthcare, education, relationships, finance, and other sectors. By leveraging our AI expertise and the SME's expertise in an important application sector, we can build a promising AI business in that sector. 

            We take responsible AI seriously and will, on ethical grounds, choose not to pursue projects that we otherwise assess to be financially sound.AI Fund is a venture studio that partners with entrepreneurs to build AI companies that move humanity forward.

            I was the Director of the Stanford AI Lab (https://ai.stanford.edu/), home to 20+ faculty members and research groups, and a tenured professor in Stanford's Computer Science department. More recently, I switched to an Adjunct Professor role. 

            My research group's work focused on AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Robotics. Notable projects include early work in Deep Learning (that led to the founding of Google Brain), early work in online education (that led to the founding of Coursera), ROS (a widely used open-source robotics development platform), and work on Reinforcement Learning for robotic control (such as the Stanford autonomous helicopter). More recent efforts include applications of AI to Healthcare and to Climate Change.I was the Director of the Stanford AI Lab (https://ai.stanford.edu/), home to 20+ faculty members and research groups, and a tenured professor in Stanford's Computer Science department.
