# HR App

My own implementation of the HR app developed in the course (WIP).

Significant modifications:

- Replaced `llama-index` with custom code for greater transparency and control.
- Replaced `gradio` with `fasthtml` for more flexibility.

Run the app:

```bash
python main.py
```

View logs:

```bash
datasette pdf_qa_logs.db
```
